      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am an Information Technology graduate (2023) with hands-on experience 
        in frontend development using React and Vite. I have built practical 
        projects to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript, component-based 
        architecture, and responsive UI design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently expanding my skills in Laravel and full-stack 
        development, with a strong interest in building scalable and 
        user-friendly web applications.
